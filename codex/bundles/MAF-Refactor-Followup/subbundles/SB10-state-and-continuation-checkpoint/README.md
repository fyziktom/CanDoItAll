# SB10: Runtime state and continuation checkpoint

## Metadata

- Phase: D — State and continuation integrity
- Depends on: `SB08`, `SB09`
- Checkpoint: Yes
- Optional: No
- Baseline: `fyziktom/CanDoItAll` `maf-refactor` @ `9e47a332fa9d329422ff616a0e0b6a97a22933c9`
- Primary executor: Claude Code / Claude Fable 5
- Reasoning profile: deepest available (`xHigh` intent)
- Compatible executor: Codex or another high-capability coding model using the included prompt
- Review findings addressed: None directly; this subbundle is an architecture checkpoint/foundation.

## Goal

Prove compatible state restores exactly, incompatible state fails or replays only through named policy, and approvals retain original context/authority.

## Required context

1. Read `../../00-READ-ME-FIRST.md`, `../../01-REVIEW-VERDICT.md`, `../../02-FINDINGS-REGISTER.md`, and `../../03-EXECUTION-ORDER.md`.
2. Read the architecture and plan documents relevant to this subbundle.
3. Read `../../sharedinfo/required-skills.md` and use installed skills.
4. Confirm every dependency is explicitly unlocked.
5. Confirm current branch/HEAD and refresh the evidence map if it differs from the baseline.
6. Create `proof/proof-manifest.json` and `proof/SESSION-HANDOFF.md` before risky edits.

## Detailed tasks

1. Run the full state fixture matrix and approval continuation tests.
2. Restart between initial approval request and continuation; verify exact proposal IDs, provider binding, authority fingerprint, workspace scope, and turn-context lease behavior.
3. Verify provider/model/tool/policy/history changes produce the expected named compatibility outcome.
4. Inspect persisted/public projections for opaque state leakage.
5. Record Pass/Blocked and migration readers retained with removal criteria.

## C# architecture impact

This is architecture-sensitive work. Map current owner, target owner, contracts, implementations, composition root, dependency direction, test seam, and old behavior to delete before editing. New interfaces without production consumption do not count as completion.

## Testability contract

- restart/resume
- state migration
- incompatible fail-closed
- public API redaction
- no current-UI recapture

Every behavior change requires at least one negative test. Extracted behavior must be directly testable without constructing the original broad runtime/workspace graph unless the test is explicitly an integration smoke.

## Constraints

- Keep source-code comments and identifiers in English.
- Do not add partial-class architecture, nested architecture owners, broad Helpers/Managers, or a Common dumping ground.
- Do not let UI observation, route, prompt text, payload JSON, or current navigation grant authority.
- Do not recapture current UI context or authority during approval continuation.
- Do not duplicate provider, tool, process, or persistence side effects for comparison.
- Do not restore product/process semantics or product module references to MAF.
- Do not make lightweight LLM calls use the full agent runtime.
- Do not add new accepted test failures or exclusions.
- Do not commit, push, or open a PR unless explicitly requested.

## High-risk points

- A test that only checks non-null restored session is insufficient.

## Required architecture proof

- before/after responsibility and dependency map
- CodeAnalytics snapshot/dependency/cycle evidence when available
- changed files/projects
- failing-first and negative tests
- focused build/test transcript
- source assertions proving the old production path no longer grants/owns the responsibility
- rollback and retained compatibility readers/selectors
- completed proof manifest and durable session handoff

## Acceptance criteria

- The goal is satisfied in the production call chain, not only in new contracts/tests.
- Authority, scope, state, approval, and process invariants remain fail-closed.
- No new reverse references, hidden service location, partial-class growth, or duplicate side-effecting paths exist.
- Focused tests, architecture guards, and all checkpoint-required validation pass.

## Stop and repair conditions

Mark this subbundle Blocked if the design requires UI-derived authority, current-context recapture, mixed workspace bundles, silent state replay, process logic in MAF, a project-reference cycle, or a test exclusion. Continue other safe in-scope work and record exact evidence; do not weaken the invariant.

## Downstream unlock

SB11 and later only on Pass.

## Required closure output
