# SB12: Inject tool policy and remove process-specific governance from the MAF adapter

## Metadata

- Phase: E — Governance and user control
- Depends on: `SB11`
- Checkpoint: No
- Optional: No
- Baseline: `fyziktom/CanDoItAll` `maf-refactor` @ `9e47a332fa9d329422ff616a0e0b6a97a22933c9`
- Primary executor: Claude Code / Claude Fable 5
- Reasoning profile: deepest available (`xHigh` intent)
- Compatible executor: Codex or another high-capability coding model using the included prompt
- Review findings addressed: `FR-007`

## Goal

Make MAF a tool-call mapper over a provider-neutral governance pipeline rather than an owner of process facts and hardcoded policy.

## Required context

1. Read `../../00-READ-ME-FIRST.md`, `../../01-REVIEW-VERDICT.md`, `../../02-FINDINGS-REGISTER.md`, and `../../03-EXECUTION-ORDER.md`.
2. Read the architecture and plan documents relevant to this subbundle.
3. Read `../../sharedinfo/required-skills.md` and use installed skills.
4. Confirm every dependency is explicitly unlocked.
5. Confirm current branch/HEAD and refresh the evidence map if it differs from the baseline.
6. Create `proof/proof-manifest.json` and `proof/SESSION-HANDOFF.md` before risky edits.

## Detailed tasks

1. Inject IAgentToolInvocationPolicy or a composed IAgentToolGovernancePipeline into MafRuntimeAgentFactory; delete direct new DefaultAgentToolInvocationPolicy().
2. Define ExecutionGovernanceSnapshot with generic resource scope, allowed operations, mutation/read grants, approval policy, external targets, managed refs, and policy fingerprint.
3. Move process-specific interpretation into a Modules.Processes contributor/decorator that narrows the generic snapshot.
4. Remove ProcessRunId/ProcessStepId/product-branch fields from MAF policy construction where they are not telemetry. Map process requirements to generic operation/resource constraints before entering MAF.
5. Make WorkspaceExecutionAuditContext telemetry-only or prove every authorization fact also arrives explicitly in the invocation command.
6. Ensure capability filtering and invocation policy use the same monotonic decision model and cannot be weakened by catalog order.
7. Expand architecture guards beyond a short token list so new process fields cannot return under different names.

## C# architecture impact

This is architecture-sensitive work. Map current owner, target owner, contracts, implementations, composition root, dependency direction, test seam, and old behavior to delete before editing. New interfaces without production consumption do not count as completion.

## Testability contract

- injected fake policy
- process contributor narrowing
- MAF without Processes host
- ambient context missing does not widen
- duplicate/collision fail-fast

Every behavior change requires at least one negative test. Extracted behavior must be directly testable without constructing the original broad runtime/workspace graph unless the test is explicitly an integration smoke.

## Constraints

- Keep source-code comments and identifiers in English.
- Do not add partial-class architecture, nested architecture owners, broad Helpers/Managers, or a Common dumping ground.
- Do not let UI observation, route, prompt text, payload JSON, or current navigation grant authority.
- Do not recapture current UI context or authority during approval continuation.
- Do not duplicate provider, tool, process, or persistence side effects for comparison.
- Do not restore product/process semantics or product module references to MAF.
- Do not make lightweight LLM calls use the full agent runtime.
- Do not add new accepted test failures or exclusions.
- Do not commit, push, or open a PR unless explicitly requested.

## High-risk points

- Do not move process logic into generic Core merely to remove a MAF reference.
- Do not reduce typed facts to unstructured JSON strings.
- Do not make telemetry AsyncLocal authoritative.

## Required architecture proof

- before/after responsibility and dependency map
- CodeAnalytics snapshot/dependency/cycle evidence when available
- changed files/projects
- failing-first and negative tests
- focused build/test transcript
- source assertions proving the old production path no longer grants/owns the responsibility
- rollback and retained compatibility readers/selectors
- completed proof manifest and durable session handoff

## Acceptance criteria

- The goal is satisfied in the production call chain, not only in new contracts/tests.
- Authority, scope, state, approval, and process invariants remain fail-closed.
- No new reverse references, hidden service location, partial-class growth, or duplicate side-effecting paths exist.
- Focused tests, architecture guards, and all checkpoint-required validation pass.

## Stop and repair conditions

Mark this subbundle Blocked if the design requires UI-derived authority, current-context recapture, mixed workspace bundles, silent state replay, process logic in MAF, a project-reference cycle, or a test exclusion. Continue other safe in-scope work and record exact evidence; do not weaken the invariant.

## Downstream unlock

SB13 checkpoint.
