# SB11: Per-proposal approval UX/API and bounded continuation lifecycle

## Metadata

- Phase: E — Governance and user control
- Depends on: `SB10`
- Checkpoint: No
- Optional: No
- Baseline: `fyziktom/CanDoItAll` `maf-refactor` @ `9e47a332fa9d329422ff616a0e0b6a97a22933c9`
- Primary executor: Claude Code / Claude Fable 5
- Reasoning profile: deepest available (`xHigh` intent)
- Compatible executor: Codex or another high-capability coding model using the included prompt
- Review findings addressed: `FR-008`, `FR-009`

## Goal

Expose the application-owned proposal model to users and bound all in-memory continuation state without weakening fail-closed behavior.

## Required context

1. Read `../../00-READ-ME-FIRST.md`, `../../01-REVIEW-VERDICT.md`, `../../02-FINDINGS-REGISTER.md`, and `../../03-EXECUTION-ORDER.md`.
2. Read the architecture and plan documents relevant to this subbundle.
3. Read `../../sharedinfo/required-skills.md` and use installed skills.
4. Confirm every dependency is explicitly unlocked.
5. Confirm current branch/HEAD and refresh the evidence map if it differs from the baseline.
6. Create `proof/proof-manifest.json` and `proof/SESSION-HANDOFF.md` before risky edits.

## Detailed tasks

1. Render each pending proposal with tool name, classification, safe details, target scope/resource summary, and independent approve/reject choice.
2. Submit IReadOnlyList<PendingToolApprovalDecision> from UI and add a decision-list HTTP endpoint or request version. Keep the bool API only as a compatibility mapper that is clearly documented as all-proposals.
3. Require exact coverage through AgentApprovalDecisionMismatchException and preserve the original proposal arguments hash/binding.
4. Add bounded TTL/size and durable-run reconciliation to the MAF approval cache; prefer reconstruction from persisted compatible session state over process-lifetime cache authority.
5. Add an abandoned WaitingOnTool reconciliation/expiry policy that can release turn-context lease capacity without auto-approving, replaying, or losing audit evidence.
6. Resolve the explicit lease-token test conflict. Recommended default: AutoApprovedNonInteractive must not expose explicit project lease tokens; scripted harnesses should model GovernedProcessAutomation when tokens are required.
7. Add multi-proposal mixed-decision component and API integration tests.

## C# architecture impact

This is architecture-sensitive work. Map current owner, target owner, contracts, implementations, composition root, dependency direction, test seam, and old behavior to delete before editing. New interfaces without production consumption do not count as completion.

## Testability contract

- approve one/reject one
- unknown/duplicate/missing decisions
- cache restart
- abandoned waiting run
- lease token purpose contract

Every behavior change requires at least one negative test. Extracted behavior must be directly testable without constructing the original broad runtime/workspace graph unless the test is explicitly an integration smoke.

## Constraints

- Keep source-code comments and identifiers in English.
- Do not add partial-class architecture, nested architecture owners, broad Helpers/Managers, or a Common dumping ground.
- Do not let UI observation, route, prompt text, payload JSON, or current navigation grant authority.
- Do not recapture current UI context or authority during approval continuation.
- Do not duplicate provider, tool, process, or persistence side effects for comparison.
- Do not restore product/process semantics or product module references to MAF.
- Do not make lightweight LLM calls use the full agent runtime.
- Do not add new accepted test failures or exclusions.
- Do not commit, push, or open a PR unless explicitly requested.

## High-risk points

- Do not expose raw tool arguments/secrets.
- Do not recapture current UI context on approval.
- Do not treat cache eviction as approval rejection without a durable decision.

## Required architecture proof

- before/after responsibility and dependency map
- CodeAnalytics snapshot/dependency/cycle evidence when available
- changed files/projects
- failing-first and negative tests
- focused build/test transcript
- source assertions proving the old production path no longer grants/owns the responsibility
- rollback and retained compatibility readers/selectors
- completed proof manifest and durable session handoff

## Acceptance criteria

- The goal is satisfied in the production call chain, not only in new contracts/tests.
- Authority, scope, state, approval, and process invariants remain fail-closed.
- No new reverse references, hidden service location, partial-class growth, or duplicate side-effecting paths exist.
- Focused tests, architecture guards, and all checkpoint-required validation pass.

## Stop and repair conditions

Mark this subbundle Blocked if the design requires UI-derived authority, current-context recapture, mixed workspace bundles, silent state replay, process logic in MAF, a project-reference cycle, or a test exclusion. Continue other safe in-scope work and record exact evidence; do not weaken the invariant.
