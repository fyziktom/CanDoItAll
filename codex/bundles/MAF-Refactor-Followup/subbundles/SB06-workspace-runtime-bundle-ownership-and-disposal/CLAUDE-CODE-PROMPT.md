# Claude Code execution prompt — SB06

<role>
You are the senior C# architecture implementer for one bounded CanDoItAll corrective subbundle. Work evidence-first and complete implementation plus validation, not only a proposal.
</role>

<executor_profile>
Primary: Claude Fable 5 in Claude Code. Use the deepest reasoning mode available. `xHigh` is an intent label, not a required literal flag. If switching models, update the durable handoff first.
</executor_profile>

<mission>
Ensure one workspace aggregate owns one process host and one disposable service graph for its full profile-workspace lifetime.
</mission>

<required_context>
Read the root review/plan documents, this subbundle README, relevant source/project files, tests, SharedInfo skills, current HEAD/diff, and CodeAnalytics evidence. Do not trust the bundle over changed source.
</required_context>

<constraints>
- Keep source-code comments and identifiers in English.
- Do not add partial-class architecture, nested architecture owners, broad Helpers/Managers, or a Common dumping ground.
- Do not let UI observation, route, prompt text, payload JSON, or current navigation grant authority.
- Do not recapture current UI context or authority during approval continuation.
- Do not duplicate provider, tool, process, or persistence side effects for comparison.
- Do not restore product/process semantics or product module references to MAF.
- Do not make lightweight LLM calls use the full agent runtime.
- Do not add new accepted test failures or exclusions.
- Do not commit, push, or open a PR unless explicitly requested.
- Work only on SB06; do not opportunistically implement later subbundles.
</constraints>

<workflow>
1. Create/update proof manifest and session handoff.
2. Inventory exact symbols, callers, project references, and current behavior.
3. Add characterization/failing tests first.
4. Implement the smallest cohesive owner-boundary change.
5. Build and run focused tests after each cutover step.
6. Exercise at least one negative/fault path.
7. Run architecture guards and inspect the diff for old-path survival.
8. Update proof/handoff continuously.
9. Return the closure output required by the README.
</workflow>

<owned_tasks>
1. Introduce an owned workspace aggregate or extend AgentFrameworkWorkspaceService ownership so WorkspaceRuntimeServices is disposed exactly once.
2. Remove the extra LocalWorkspaceProcessHost from CanDoItAllAgentWorkspaceFactory; use the bundle process host for command execution, boundary description, lease cleanup, and recovery.
3. Define ownership for handoff participants: they may share a run bundle but only the parent build owns disposal.
4. Verify scoped DI and manually constructed profile workspaces use equivalent graphs and lifetimes.
5. On profile switch, cancel active work, persist terminal state as applicable, stop owned processes, dispose bundle, and only then expose the new workspace.
6. Add instance-count and disposal tests, including failed construction and partial handoff build.
