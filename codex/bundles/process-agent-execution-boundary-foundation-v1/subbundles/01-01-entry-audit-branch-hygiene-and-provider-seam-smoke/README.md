# SB01: Entry audit, branch hygiene, and provider seam smoke

## Status

- Status: Completed

## Objective

Reconfirm the current branch is clean, provider decoupling remains intact, and large-screen-only proof scope is recorded.

## Covered Inputs

- `inputs/00-original-request.md`
- `inputs/01-branch-review-summary.md`
- `inputs/02-source-artifacts.md`
- `inputs/03-large-screen-only-proof-policy.md`

## Prerequisites

- None; start from current `maf-processes-refactor`.

## Exact Source References

- `repo://src/CanDoItAll.Modules.Processes/Automation/Dispatch/ProcessRunAutomationDispatchService.cs`
- `repo://src/CanDoItAll.Modules.Processes/Automation/Dispatch/ProcessRunAutomationDispatchService.Execution.cs`
- `repo://src/CanDoItAll.AgentFramework.Maf/CanDoItAll.AgentFramework.Maf.csproj`
- `repo://src/CanDoItAll.AgentFramework.Tooling/IAgentRuntimeToolProvider.cs`
- `repo://codex/bundles/maf-processes-provider-hardening-followup-v1/proof/SB12/source-assertions/next-phase-cutline.md`

## Deliverables / Scope

- Subbundle-specific source changes or proof artifacts.
- Updated tests/scans where applicable.
- Proof manifest and semantic invariants.
- Execution report entry.
- Large-screen-only UI proof decision.

## Dependency Impact

- Owned requirements: RQ-001, RQ-002, RQ-013
- Downstream subbundles must not start until this closure gate passes.
- If this subbundle is a gate/checkpoint, downstream proof is untrustworthy until the gate passes.

## Validation Depth

- Source scan proof.
- Targeted unit/integration proof when production code changes.
- Full build at gate or final phases.
- Browser validation: `N/A` unless UI changed; if UI changed, large-screen PC only.

## Implementation Steps

1. Compare branch against `development` and confirm no accidental historical bundle deletions remain.
2. Run hidden MAF product-tool dependency scan.
3. Run provider composition smoke or targeted tests from the previous bundle.
4. Record large-screen-only proof policy in execution report.
5. Do not modify production code in this subbundle unless branch hygiene requires it.

## Scope Exceptions

- Full Process Core extraction is out of scope.
- Driver packs are out of scope.
- Small/medium/mobile proof is out of scope.

## Do Not Do

- Do not reintroduce MAF product-tool dependencies.
- Do not rename process tools.
- Do not weaken access policy.
- Do not move EF entities.
- Do not create driver packs.
- Do not run small, medium, or mobile UI validation.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [x] Objective completed.
- [x] Source assertions recorded.
- [x] Targeted tests pass.
- [x] Previous provider seam preserved.
- [x] No forbidden product dependency introduced.
- [x] No mobile/small/medium screenshots produced.
- [x] Execution report updated.

## Proof Required

- `proof/SB01/manifest.md`
- `proof/SB01/semantic-invariants.md`
- `proof/SB01/source-assertions/*.txt`
- `proof/SB01/transcripts/*.txt`

## Browser Validation Logging

- N/A unless this subbundle unexpectedly changes rendered UI. If UI is changed, validate only in a large-screen PC viewport and record route, viewport, assertions, and screenshot. Do not test small/medium/mobile.

## Progression Gate

- Closure checklist complete.
- No reopen trigger active.
- Gate subbundles SB04, SB07, and SB10 require explicit refactor checkpoint sign-off.

## Suggested Agent Prompt

Implement SB01 from `process-agent-execution-boundary-foundation-v1`. Follow the exact source references, do not broaden scope, and do not proceed to the next subbundle until the progression gate passes.
