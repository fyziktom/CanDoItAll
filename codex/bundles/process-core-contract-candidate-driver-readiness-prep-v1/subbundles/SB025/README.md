# SB025 - Static wrapper inventory and movement plan

## Status
Completed.

## Objective
Inventory remaining ProcessRunAutomationDispatchService static wrappers and classify each as pure rule, application helper, or compatibility seam.

## Covered Inputs
- Preserve existing behavior.
- Do not rush Process Core.
- Avoid production driver API.
- Runtime/service refactor only; browser validation is expected N/A.

## Prerequisites
- SB024 closed.

## Exact Source References

- `repo://src/CanDoItAll.Modules.Processes/Automation/Dispatch/ProcessDispatchRouteModels.cs`
- `repo://src/CanDoItAll.Modules.Processes/Automation/Dispatch/ProcessDispatchRouteModelAdapters.cs`
- `repo://src/CanDoItAll.Modules.Processes/Automation/Dispatch/ProcessDispatchRouteServices.cs`
- `repo://src/CanDoItAll.Modules.Processes/Automation/Dispatch/ProcessDispatchCandidateHydrationService.cs`

- `repo://tests/CanDoItAll.Tests.Integration/ProcessRunAutomationDispatchServiceTests.cs`


## Deliverables
- Code refactor for this slice, or documented N/A if source inspection proves it already complete.
- Focused tests or source assertions for the moved behavior.
- Proof transcript under `codex/bundles/process-core-contract-candidate-driver-readiness-prep-v1/proof/SB025/`.
- Execution report row for `SB025`.

## Dependency Impact
- Feeds the next critical gate.

## Validation Depth
- Focused source/test proof; full gate proof can be accumulated by the next critical gate.

## Implementation Steps
1. Re-read the exact source references and update the local inventory for this slice.
2. Identify the smallest behavior-preserving move for this subbundle.
3. Keep side effects explicitly named; do not hide EF, storage, workspace, AgentFramework, or transition writes behind misleading pure helpers.
4. Update or add focused tests before closing the subbundle.
5. Run source scans for forbidden Process Core, driver API, UI/media, stub, and adapter leakage.
6. Record proof and update the execution report.

## Scope Exceptions
- Do not create `CanDoItAll.Processes.Core`.
- Do not create production process driver interfaces or registries.
- Do not broaden into UI/mobile/browser proof.

## Do Not Do
- Do not simplify behavior.
- Do not remove recovery/finalizer/projection paths.
- Do not collapse multiple subbundle rows into one report row.
- Do not leave adapter logic in route-facing services unless this subbundle explicitly owns a named edge adapter.

## Acceptance Checklist
- [x] Behavior preserved.
- [x] Source references inspected.
- [x] Tests/source scans updated.
- [x] No Core project.
- [x] No production driver API.
- [x] No UI/mobile proof drift.
- [x] Execution report row added.

## Completion Notes
- Added the static wrapper inventory and movement plan at `bundle://analysis/04-static-wrapper-inventory.md`.
- No production code was changed in SB025. The smallest safe change is classification only; SB026 owns pure-rule movement and SB027 owns Gate I parity proof.
- Browser validation: N/A - runtime/service inventory only; no UI files changed.

## Proof Captured
- Entry gate: `bundle://proof/SB025/transcripts/entry-gate.txt`
- Closure gate: `bundle://proof/SB025/transcripts/closure-gate.txt`
- Inventory scan: `bundle://proof/SB025/transcripts/static-wrapper-inventory-scan.txt`
- Source assertions and forbidden-token scans: `bundle://proof/SB025/transcripts/source-assertions-and-scans.txt`
- Build: `bundle://proof/SB025/transcripts/build.txt`
- Changed-file hashes: `bundle://proof/SB025/transcripts/changed-file-hashes.txt`

## Proof Required
- Build/test transcript or explanation if proof is deferred to the next critical gate.
- Source assertion transcript.
- Anti-stub scan.
- No-Core/no-driver scan.

## Browser Validation Logging
- N/A - runtime/service refactor only. If any UI file changes unexpectedly, stop and reopen the scope.

## Progression Gate
- May proceed to the next subbundle only if source compiles locally or the change is proof/documentation only.

## Suggested Agent Prompt
Implement `SB025` from `process-core-contract-candidate-driver-readiness-prep-v1`. Preserve runtime behavior. Keep this work module-local and do not introduce Process Core or production driver APIs.
