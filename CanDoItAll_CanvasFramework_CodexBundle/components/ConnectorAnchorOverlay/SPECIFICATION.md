# ConnectorAnchorOverlay Specification

## Purpose

Show connector anchor points, connection affordances, and routing handles on selected or hovered nodes.

## User scenarios

- Create or reroute dependencies in Project Structure.
- Connect prompt flow nodes, branches, or future validation overlays in Prompt Factory.
- Debug connector origin/target geometry during QA.

## Functional scope

### Minimum viable version

Visible anchor points for hovered or selected nodes with connection start/cancel callbacks.

### Target advanced version

Direction-aware anchors, smart routing previews, and inline anchor badges or labels.

## Visual behavior

The component should appear above the canvas content with consistent elevation, radius, spacing, and theme tokens. It must avoid occluding critical content whenever an anchored placement can solve that.

## Interaction behavior

This component owns interaction semantics within its boundary and must coordinate cleanly with SelectionModel, HoverFocusRouter, KeyboardShortcutRouter, and the surrounding shell.

## Component states

- Hidden
- Visible
- Focused
- Dismissed
- Error

## Edge cases

- Null or incomplete input model arriving during a mid-refresh state.
- Rapid successive updates caused by selection changes, drag loops, or remote persistence echoes.
- Read-only or disabled mode where visuals still need to render but actions must not execute.
- Self-loop connector.
- Hidden or collapsed target node.
- Connector path crossing group/frame boundaries.

## Error behavior

Show a localized inline error state when user-facing actions fail, keep the previous stable state visible, and preserve focus for retry or cancel.

## Responsibilities

- Present a focused high-level interaction surface.
- Own visibility/focus/commit lifecycle within its boundary.
- Coordinate cleanly with the shell and selection state.

## Responsibility boundaries

- Does not become a catch-all for unrelated page actions.
- Does not duplicate shared shell responsibilities.
- Does not bypass selection/focus rules.

## Inputs

- Typed props/model.
- Current scene/viewport context.
- Selection or focus state when relevant.
- Theme and interaction settings.

## Outputs

- Rendered visual or interaction state.
- Typed callbacks/events.
- Optional diagnostics metadata.

## Parameters / props / configuration

- Id
- IsReadOnly
- IsDisabled
- ThemeKey
- IsOpen
- AnchorRect
- PlacementMode
- ZIndex

## Data model

Visibility state + anchor/placement state + local draft/action state + callback payloads.

## Dependencies

- ConnectorPathPrimitive
- HitTestService
- HoverFocusRouter
- DiagnosticsOverlay

## Performance requirements

Render anchors only for relevant nodes and reuse hit zones across frames.

## UX/UI notes

Anchors should appear on intent and remain discoverable without creating permanent visual clutter.

## Accessibility notes

Offer keyboard-driven connect mode and inspector-based connection alternatives.

## Recommended implementation in Blazor + C#

Use Blazor components for structure and state orchestration. Only push to JS the overlay positioning, pointer-heavy geometry, or runtime-owned rendering details.

## Recommended JS layer

Implement a dedicated JS module with a narrow public API. Own pointer-heavy math, rendering loops, hit testing, and host integration there; keep business and persistence decisions in C#.

## Animation guidance

Use very short fade/scale transitions and respect reduced-motion preferences. State clarity is more important than decoration.

## Render strategy

Use a hybrid strategy: DOM for rich card/editing content, SVG or canvas for geometric overlays, and CSS transforms for viewport movement.

## Test recommendations

Cover anchor visibility rules, start/complete/cancel flows, and overlap cases.

## Validation recommendations

- Validate all typed input contracts and reject invalid IDs or impossible bounds early.
- Add at least one component test and one targeted logic test for the primary behavior.
- Confirm no duplicate shared abstraction is created next to the existing framework entry points.
- Verify read-only/disabled behavior and error fallback handling.
- Check performance under large or rapidly changing scenes when the component participates in hot paths.

## Future extensions

- Direction-aware anchors, smart routing previews, and inline anchor badges or labels.
- Allow plugins or domain adapters to extend this component without forking the shared framework.
- Add diagnostics and performance counters before increasing runtime complexity.

## API proposal

```csharp
public sealed class ConnectorAnchorOverlayProps
{
    public string Id { get; init; } = string.Empty;
    public bool IsOpen { get; init; }
    public bool IsReadOnly { get; init; }
}
```

## Internal structure

- Visibility controller
- Anchor/placement resolver
- Presentation component
- Dismissal/focus policy

## Responsiveness

Primary target is desktop, but the component should still avoid brittle assumptions about host size, zoom level, or maximized state.

## Theming / styling / skinning

Consume semantic theme tokens rather than hardcoded colors or spacing. Stay dark/light-ready even if the current product ships only one theme at first.

## ASCII sketch

```text
      +----------------------+
      | overlay / popover    |
+-----+----------------------+-----+
|         selected target          |
+----------------------------------+
```

## State diagram

```text
Hidden -> Visible -> Focused -> Hidden
            \-> Dismissed ----^
```

## Event list

- Opened
- Closed
- ActionInvoked
- AnchorChanged

## Callback list

- OnOpened
- OnClosed
- OnActionInvoked

## Validation scenarios

- Happy-path render or interaction flow works from start to finish.
- Read-only and disabled states suppress actions without breaking layout.
- Error fallback preserves a stable UI and exposes diagnostics.
- Component integrates cleanly with its declared dependencies and does not bypass shared ownership boundaries.
- Interop contract is stable, coarse-grained, and does not spam cross-boundary calls during hot interactions.
