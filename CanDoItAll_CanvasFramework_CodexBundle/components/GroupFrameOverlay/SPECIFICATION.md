# GroupFrameOverlay Specification

## Purpose

Render group frames, selection borders, logical swimlanes, and future grouping containers around sets of nodes.

## User scenarios

- Selection border creation in Project Structure.
- Prompt Factory branch lanes or grouped workflow stages.
- Future milestone frames, scope boxes, or validation regions.

## Functional scope

### Minimum viable version

Shared frame rendering and node-membership contract with label and tone support.

### Target advanced version

Collapsible grouped containers, inline frame toolbars, nested frames, and export-ready grouping semantics.

## Visual behavior

The component should appear above the canvas content with consistent elevation, radius, spacing, and theme tokens. It must avoid occluding critical content whenever an anchored placement can solve that.

## Interaction behavior

This component owns interaction semantics within its boundary and must coordinate cleanly with SelectionModel, HoverFocusRouter, KeyboardShortcutRouter, and the surrounding shell.

## Component states

- Hidden
- Visible
- Focused
- Dismissed
- Error

## Edge cases

- Null or incomplete input model arriving during a mid-refresh state.
- Rapid successive updates caused by selection changes, drag loops, or remote persistence echoes.
- Read-only or disabled mode where visuals still need to render but actions must not execute.

## Error behavior

Show a localized inline error state when user-facing actions fail, keep the previous stable state visible, and preserve focus for retry or cancel.

## Responsibilities

- Present a focused high-level interaction surface.
- Own visibility/focus/commit lifecycle within its boundary.
- Coordinate cleanly with the shell and selection state.

## Responsibility boundaries

- Does not become a catch-all for unrelated page actions.
- Does not duplicate shared shell responsibilities.
- Does not bypass selection/focus rules.

## Inputs

- Typed props/model.
- Current scene/viewport context.
- Selection or focus state when relevant.
- Theme and interaction settings.

## Outputs

- Rendered visual or interaction state.
- Typed callbacks/events.
- Optional diagnostics metadata.

## Parameters / props / configuration

- Id
- IsReadOnly
- IsDisabled
- ThemeKey
- IsOpen
- AnchorRect
- PlacementMode
- ZIndex

## Data model

Visibility state + anchor/placement state + local draft/action state + callback payloads.

## Dependencies

- LayoutEngine
- SelectionModel
- ContainerPrimitive

## Performance requirements

Update only frames affected by changed membership or moved nodes.

## UX/UI notes

Frames should read as contextual grouping, not as another selection layer competing with marquee or handles.

## Accessibility notes

Group membership should be summarized in the inspector and semantic mirror.

## Recommended implementation in Blazor + C#

Use Blazor components for structure and state orchestration. Only push to JS the overlay positioning, pointer-heavy geometry, or runtime-owned rendering details.

## Recommended JS layer

Implement a dedicated JS module with a narrow public API. Own pointer-heavy math, rendering loops, hit testing, and host integration there; keep business and persistence decisions in C#.

## Animation guidance

Use very short fade/scale transitions and respect reduced-motion preferences. State clarity is more important than decoration.

## Render strategy

Use a hybrid strategy: DOM for rich card/editing content, SVG or canvas for geometric overlays, and CSS transforms for viewport movement.

## Test recommendations

Cover frame bounds, nesting, and multi-selection border generation.

## Validation recommendations

- Validate all typed input contracts and reject invalid IDs or impossible bounds early.
- Add at least one component test and one targeted logic test for the primary behavior.
- Confirm no duplicate shared abstraction is created next to the existing framework entry points.
- Verify read-only/disabled behavior and error fallback handling.
- Check performance under large or rapidly changing scenes when the component participates in hot paths.

## Future extensions

- Collapsible grouped containers, inline frame toolbars, nested frames, and export-ready grouping semantics.
- Allow plugins or domain adapters to extend this component without forking the shared framework.
- Add diagnostics and performance counters before increasing runtime complexity.

## API proposal

```csharp
public sealed class GroupFrameOverlayProps
{
    public string Id { get; init; } = string.Empty;
    public bool IsOpen { get; init; }
    public bool IsReadOnly { get; init; }
}
```

## Internal structure

- Visibility controller
- Anchor/placement resolver
- Presentation component
- Dismissal/focus policy

## Responsiveness

The component should define how it collapses, docks, or repositions on narrower stage widths. Avoid assuming a permanent ultra-wide desktop canvas.

## Theming / styling / skinning

Consume semantic theme tokens rather than hardcoded colors or spacing. Stay dark/light-ready even if the current product ships only one theme at first.

## ASCII sketch

```text
      +----------------------+
      | overlay / popover    |
+-----+----------------------+-----+
|         selected target          |
+----------------------------------+
```

## State diagram

```text
Hidden -> Visible -> Focused -> Hidden
            \-> Dismissed ----^
```

## Event list

- Opened
- Closed
- ActionInvoked
- AnchorChanged

## Callback list

- OnOpened
- OnClosed
- OnActionInvoked

## Validation scenarios

- Happy-path render or interaction flow works from start to finish.
- Read-only and disabled states suppress actions without breaking layout.
- Error fallback preserves a stable UI and exposes diagnostics.
- Component integrates cleanly with its declared dependencies and does not bypass shared ownership boundaries.
- Old ownership point is genuinely reduced or removed after extraction.
- Interop contract is stable, coarse-grained, and does not spam cross-boundary calls during hot interactions.
