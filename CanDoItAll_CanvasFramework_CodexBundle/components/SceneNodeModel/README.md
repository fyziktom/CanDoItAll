# SceneNodeModel

SceneNodeModel is a P0 shared low-level component in the category `Utility and infrastructure components`.

## Status summary

| --- | --- |
| Category | Utility and infrastructure components |
| Status | missing |
| Priority | P0 |
| Level | low-level |
| Scope | shared |
| JS bridge | none |
| Implementation wave | Wave 1 |

## Purpose

Define the internal scene graph contract used by shared graph components: nodes, children, bounds, transforms, visibility, hit regions, and state flags.

## Why this component is needed

The current workbench contracts describe surface DTOs but not a reusable scene graph. A formal node model is needed to stop page-level graph projection and ad hoc render bookkeeping.

## Main use cases

- Represent container nodes, connectors, overlays, and decorations in one normalized graph.
- Support grouping, clipping, z-ordering, and dirty-region invalidation.
- Allow domain adapters to project domain data into a stable shared rendering model.

## Architectural context

Shared canvas framework inside `CanDoItAll.ComponentKit`, consumed by Project Structure and Prompt Factory through explicit adapters.

## Current-state summary

SceneNodeModel is currently missing as a first-class component. The implementation should introduce it at the framework boundary defined in this bundle and wire it into the existing pages/services through the listed integration seams.

## Recommended target paths

- `src/CanDoItAll.ComponentKit/Canvas/Core/SceneNodeModel.cs`
- `tests/CanDoItAll.Tests.Components/SceneNodeModelTests.cs`

## Relevant existing repository files

- `src/CanDoItAll.ComponentKit/Canvas/CanvasWorkbenchContracts.cs#L5-L340` — Defines the shared graph-workbench DTO layer: surface, nodes, links, UI state, chrome, actions, chips, group frames, and typed callback payloads. Key symbols: CanvasWorkbenchSurface, CanvasWorkbenchNode, CanvasWorkbenchLink, CanvasWorkbenchUiState, CanvasWorkbenchChrome, CanvasWorkbenchAction, ....
- `src/CanDoItAll.ComponentKit/wwwroot/js/canvasWorkbenchInterop.js#L1-L4099` — Main shared graph runtime. Owns normalization, DOM/SVG rendering, measurement, links, group frames, context menus, create composers, drag, marquee, zoom, pan, maximize, and exported JS interop surface. Key symbols: mountFloatingInspector, normalizeSurface, buildNodeLookup, computeResolvedNodePositions, renderLinks, renderGroupFrames, ....
- `src/CanDoItAll.Modules.Factory/Pages/PromptFactoryPage.razor#L1-L2866` — Main prompt builder/editor page. Uses the shared workbench shell but still builds graph projection, branch lanes, attachments, and UI-state persistence inline in the page. Key symbols: BuildCanvasNodes, BuildCanvasLinks, HandleCanvasSelectionChangedAsync, HandleCanvasNodesMovedAsync, HandleCanvasStateChangedAsync, PersistCanvasUiStateAsync, ....
- `src/CanDoItAll.Modules.Workbench/Pages/ProjectStructurePage.razor#L1-L1399` — Primary graph-editor page for project structure. Wires the shared workbench shell, builds nodes/actions, persists positions and view state, hosts inspector panels, and still contains several canvas-specific policies that should move into shared/domain adapter components. Key symbols: MapCanvasNode, HandleSelectionChangedAsync, HandleNodesMovedAsync, HandleCanvasStateChangedAsync, HandleCreateActionAsync, HandleCanvasActionAsync, ....

## Recommended implementation approach

1. Inspect the referenced files and mark the exact logic that currently owns this responsibility.
2. Create the new `SceneNodeModel` boundary in the recommended target path(s).
3. Create the component without introducing duplicate DTOs or a shadow runtime. Extend the current shared contracts and adapters rather than creating a second system.
4. Wire the new component into the nearest shared or domain adapter seam instead of layering it directly into page code.
5. Add or update tests at the most appropriate level (pure logic, component wrapper, or page regression).
6. Remove or deprecate the old ownership point once parity is reached.

## Reuse / refactor rule

Create the component without introducing duplicate DTOs or a shadow runtime. Extend the current shared contracts and adapters rather than creating a second system.
